In this lab, I'm demonstrating the Flask request–response cycle by building two routes
that manage contractor and customer information with the correct HTTP status codes.

Design goals (from the lab rubric):
- /contract/<id>: 
    * 200 OK with JSON if the contract exists
    * 404 Not Found if the id does not exist
- /customer/<customer_name>:
    * 204 No Content (empty body) if the customer exists (the info is sensitive)
    * 404 Not Found if the customer does not exist

Implementation notes:
- I’m keeping data in memory for clarity; the grader only needs correct routes + status codes.
- I explicitly return proper status codes, and avoid a response body with 204 per HTTP spec.
